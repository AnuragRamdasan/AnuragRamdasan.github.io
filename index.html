  I invest in startups on behalf of 3one4 Capital.

  Before that, I used to work at EdCast, a startup based out of Silicon Valley,
  which I joined as employee #1. I worked on the tech platform and infrastructure
  working on different technologies like AWS, Ruby on Rails, Python, React and Angular Js.

  I am also a Founding Member and first volunteer at Code For India, a not for
  profit that works with other NGOs and pairs them up with volunteer software developers.
