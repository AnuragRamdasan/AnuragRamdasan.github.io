  I head the Investment Team at 3one4 Capital.

  At 3one4 Capital, I work extensively on the investment side managing
  evaluations of new startups and doing diligence on them. I also spend a lot of
  my time working with portfolio companies and their founding teams across tech,
  product, business strategy and fund raising.

  As part of the Investment operations at 3one4 Capital, I have focused on
  ensuring that 3one4 Capital is able to find the best of the companies to
  invest in while at the same time giving equal priority to each company that
  writes to the investment firm. Having interacted with over 3000 companies so
  far, I have led the team to build extensive software systems that make
  efficient the process of speaking with companies right from thescheduling
  of meetings all the way to evaluations. This has helped us maximize
  interactions with startups and at the same time ensuring that it is
  done efficiently.

  I am also the Founding Member of Code For India, a 501Â©(3) not-for-profit,
  centered on the getting engineers to work with other NGOs and help develop
  technology solutions for them pro-bono. I have been associated with Code For
  India since inception and has been supporting them on the technology as well
  as on ground operations organizing hackathons at Google and Rashtrapati Bhavan
  in 2015.

  Before 3one4, I was the first employee at Edcast, an education technology
  startup in the San Francisco Bay Area. As the first employee, I architected
  the tech platform from ground up, also helping hire and setup an engineering
  team that helped the company scale and serve large clients such as Salesforce,
  GE, HP, Accenture, Walmart, the WEF, and NASSCOM. Edcast is now a
  multi-million dollar revenue business with top tier investors such as
  SoftBank, GE Capital, and Menlo Ventures. Over my time there, I have deployed
  applications across the world including China, worked with some of the largest
  global corporations as clients, hired and trained engineering teams, and
  built complex large-scale systems that now train millions of employees in
  multiple geographies.

  Outside of work, I independently continue to write code and build apps and deploy and have multiple of those running live currently.
